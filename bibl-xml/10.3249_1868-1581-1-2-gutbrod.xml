2 In a nutshell, direct expropriation is the compulsory transfer of legal title or the outright seizure of property by the State. In contrast, indirect expropriation refers to the situation in which the investor formally remains legal owner. See, instead of all, M. Sornarajah, The International Law on Foreign Investment, 2nd ed. (2004), 344, with further references. See generally, C. N. Brower &amp; J. D.

7 From an analytical point of view, one can distinguish between “creeping” and “consequential expropriation”. “‘Creeping’ expropriation is comprised out of a number of elements, none of which can – separately - constitute the international wrong.” Reis- man &amp; Sloane, supra note 3, 123, 125–127. Intention to harm the investment or the investor or an intention to expropriate is not necessary but helps to prove a creeping expropriation; Reisman &amp; Sloane, supra note 3, 124, 128. Cf. also Compañía de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, at para. 7.5.20 (hereafter referred to as Compañía de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal); Siemens AG v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Award, 6 February 2007, at para. 270 (hereafter referred to as Siemens AG). See also C. Schachter, The Concept of Expropriation under the ECT and other Investment Protection Treaties, in 2 Transnational Dispute Management (2005) 3, available at: www.transnational-dispute-management.com (last visited 9 April 2009); A. Newcombe &amp; L. Paradell, Law and Practice of Investment Treaties – Standards of Treatment (2009), 343-344; Reinisch, supra note 3, 426-431. “Consequential expropriation” refers to the situation in which the host State fails to properly create, maintain and manage “the legal, administrative, and regulatory normative framework contemplated by the relevant BIT, an indispensable feature of the ‘favourable conditions’ for investment.” Reisman &amp; Sloane, supra note 3, 129, 130. Here, also, an intention on the part of the host State is not required. Reisman &amp; Sloane, supra note 3, 129.

9 Cf. CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, 12 May 2005 (hereafter referred to as CMS); Saluka Investments B.V. (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic, Partial Award, 17 March 2006; Azurix v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award, 14 July 2006; LG&amp;E Energy Corp., LG&amp;E Capital Corp. and LG&amp;E International Inc. v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006 (hereafter referred to as LG&amp;E Energy Corp.); PSEG Global, Inc. and Konya Ilgin Elektrik Üretim ve Ticaret Limited Şirketi v. Turkey, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5, Award, 19 January 2007; Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets L.P. v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Award, 22 May 2007 (hereafter referred to as Enron Corp.); Sempra Energy v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award, 28 September 2007 (hereafter referred to as Sempra Energy); for cases where State action amounted to both indirect expropriation as well as to a breach of the “fair and equitable treatment” standard, cf. Siemens AG, supra note 6; Compañía de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentina, supra note 6. Many BITs provide in rather repetitive wording not only for “fair and equitable treatment” but also for “full protection and security” and prohibit “unreasonable or discriminatory measures in the course of management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments”; Article 2(2) of the Agreement between The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics concerning the promotion and reciprocal protection of investments, signed 6 April 1989, entered into force 3 July 1991. In academic writing, much effort has been spent on the question of whether and how the concepts of “fair and equitable treatment”, “full protection and security” and “non-discrimination” are to be delimited from each other.
10 Occasionally, if it is helpful in making an argument more explicit, we might also make reference to the concept of “fair and equitable treatment”, part of the treatment standards attributable to a foreign investment by virtue of IIAs.
11 Russia, like many countries around the world, has become party to a variety of bilateral and multilateral international agreements (at least partly) concerned with or related to the protection of foreign investment, i.e. numerous bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with all major capital exporting countries (Russia had signed 56 BITs as of 1 June 2005, of which 30 had entered into force; for a detailed list, see the UNCTAD Website at www.unctad.org/sections/dite_pcbb/docs/bits_russian_federa tion_en.pdf (last visited 29 August 2005); the full text can be accessed via www.unctadxi.org/templates/DocSearch____779.aspx (last visited 29 August 2005)); The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its First Protocol, available at www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/ D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf (last visited 11 August 2005); and the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation, available at europa.eu.int/comm/external_relations/ceeca/pca/pca_russia.pdf (last visited 11 August 2005) with the European Union. Russia is also a signatory to the European Energy Charter Treaty, available at www.encharter.org (last visited 28 August 2005) and is provisionally applying it while the ratification process is pending before the Duma.
12 Reisman &amp; Sloane, supra note 3, 118–119; differing C. McLachlan et al. (eds), International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles (2007), 291, at para. 8.72-8.74; cf. also Mr. Eudoro Armando Olguín v. Paraguay, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/5, Award, 26 July 2001, at para. 84; Sea-Land Services, Inc. v. Iran, 6 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. (1984), 149 (hereafter referred to as Sea-Land Services).
13 Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969, available at www.un.org/law/ilc/texts/treaties.htm (last visited 11 August 2005), asks to have due regard to the object and purpose in the construction of a treaty. Most, if not all, BITs, as well as multinational agreements on investment protection such as the European Energy Treaty or the NAFTA, intend, as provided for in their preambles, to establish favourable conditions for investment by nationals and companies of one State in the territory of the other State. For a review of typical preambles, see Dolzer &amp;Stevens, supra note 8, 20–21. In short, they envisage a “healthy investment climate” which is conditio sine qua non for the attraction of foreign direct investment. Those treaties “contemplate […] an effective normative framework: impartial courts, an efficient and legally restrained bureaucracy, and the measure of transparency in decision”; Reisman &amp; Sloane, supra note 3, 117. If a State signs up to such a treaty, it must be aware that it not only opens its doors to foreign investment but also commits itself to establish and/or maintain an appropriate legal, administrative, and regulatory framework; Reisman &amp; Sloane, supra note 3, 117; undecided, Dolzer, supra note 12, 73–74. See, for such an approach, Kuwait v. American Independent Oil Co. (Aminoil), Final Award, 24 May 1982 (hereafter referred to as Aminoil), 21 ILM (1982), 976, at para. 147; Mondev Int’l Ltd v. United States of America, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, 42 ILM (2003), 110, para. 127. Some may argue now that an investment treaty is intended to benefit both investor and host State and that, thus, the rights and obligations of both sides need to be recognized; see Dolzer, who stipulates this question at Dolzer, supra, 74. As much as this is true, this argument does not speak against the aforementioned. It must be stressed again that BITs and MITs are not intended to prohibit legitimate regulatory measures by the host State. On the contrary, they encourage the host State to exercise its regulatory powers in a transparent, non-discriminating, non-abusive way guided by reason and the rule of law, at least towards the foreign investor. In doing so, the host State is maintaining a “healthy investment climate” which, as already said, is essential for the attraction of foreign capital. The establishment of such a administrative framework will, ultimately, lead to an improvement of the overall governance standards in the host State.

18 The Oscar Chinn Case, U.K. v. Belgium, Award, 12 December 1934 (hereafter referred to as Oscar Chinn), PCIJ Rep. Series A/B, No. 63, 88: “No enterprise […] can escape from the chances and hazards resulting from general economic conditions. Some industries may be able to make large profits during a period of general prosperity, or else by taking advantage of a treaty of commerce or of an alteration in customs duties; but they are also exposed to the danger of ruin or extinction if circumstances change. Where this is the case, no vested rights are violated by the State.”; Starrett Housing Corp. v. Iran, 4 Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal Rep. (1983), 156: (hereafter referred to as Starrett Housing) “Investors in Iran, like investors in all other countries, have to assume a risk that the country might experience strikes, lock-outs, disturbances, changes of economic and political system and even revolution. That any of these risks materialised does not necessarily mean that property rights affected by such events can be deemed to have been taken.” Feldman, supra note 15, para. 112: “Governments, in their exercise of regulatory power, frequently change their laws and regulations in response to changing economic circumstances or changing political, economic or social considerations. Those changes may well make certain activities less profitable or even uneconomic to continue […]”.

Kolo, ‘Environmental Regulation, Investment Protection and “Regulatory Taking” in International Law’, 50 International and Comparative Law Quarterly (2001), 813; Reisman &amp; Sloane, supra note 3, 121. A wide range of State measures may be interpreted as expropriatory if those measures significantly reduce the value of the property rights of an investor or render them useless; see Reisman &amp; Sloane, supra note 3, 123.

24 One strand of case law supports this doctrine: Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton v. Tams-Affa Consulting Engineers of Iran (hereafter referred to as Tippetts), 6 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. (1984), 225–226; Starrett Housing, supra note 17, 154; Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Iran, 10 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. (1986), 130; Metalclad Corp. v.

25 Another strand of case law suggests that there are more factors to be taken into consideration: Oscar Chinn, supra note 17, 88. See also T. Weiler, ‘Saving Oscar Chinn: Non-Discrimination in International Investment Law’, in N. Horn, (ed.), Arbitrating Foreign Investment Disputes (2004), 159-192; Barcelona Traction, Light &amp; Power Co., Belgium v. Spain, (hereafter referred to as Barcelona Traction), ICJ Rep.

The United Mexican States, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May 2003, at para. 116 (hereafter referred to as Tecmed); see also the Feldman case, supra note 15. For a more detailed analysis of the presented case law, refer to AlQurashi, supra note 22, 909–911, Dolzer, supra note 12, 81–86.
26 Dolzer points at the weakness of the “sole effect doctrine”, stating that “the proponents of the ‘sole effect doctrine’ would have to explain why international law protecting aliens should require a higher standard of protection than the major domestic legal orders”; Dolzer, supra note 12, 91.

37 “Investors are ready, and can be expected to be ready, to accept the regulatory regime in situations in which they invest [because they are in the position to make a risk/reward assessment of their investment]. Investment protection rather turns around the issues of unexpected changes with an excessive detrimental impact on the foreign investor’s prior calculation.” Wälde &amp; Kolo, supra note 19, 819. Courts, tribunals [cf. Aminoil, supra note 12, 1034; Phillips Petroleum Co. Iran v. Iran, 21 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. (1989), 79 et seq.; Amoco International Finance Corporation v. Iran, 15 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. (1987), 189 et seq.; Starrett Housing, supra note 17; Metalclad, supra note 23, paras 89, 99; Feldman, supra note 15, paras 145 et seq.; Tecmed, supra note, paras 91, 149 et seq., 154; International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v.

Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006, para. 195 (hereafter referred to as LG&amp;E Capital). Also, the ECHR has relied on this concept; see the ECHR cases quoted by Dolzer, supra note 33, 78–79, and commentators cf. e.g. AlQurashi, supra note 22, 913; see also Wälde &amp; Kolo, supra note 19, 821 et seq., who want to rely heavily on jurisprudence of the U.S. Supreme Court] have frequently referred to the interpretative factor of the “disappointment of legitimate expectations”. In order to distinguish regulation from indirect expropriation, one has to ask whether the State has frustrated the legitimate expectations of the investor based on representations and actions of the host State. In order to do so, one must base one’s evaluation on the facts, taking into account all aspects of the specific case at hand. Not only contractual commitments formalize legitimate expectations but also formal governmental promises in treaties, laws and even investment brochures do so. See A. A. Fatouros, Government Guarantees to Foreign Investors (1962), 69 et seq.; more critical: Sornarajah, supra note 1, 100 et seq.; just recently, M. W. Reisman &amp; M. H. Arsanjani, ‘The Question of Unilateral Governmental Statements as Applicable Law in Investment Disputes’, 19 ICSID Review (2004), 328-343, which lacks, however, a dogmatic explanation of how a State can bind itself by unilateral statement - despite its value as evidence for the creation of legitimate expectations within the concept of indirect expropriation or fair and equitable treatment - in international law towards an investor which is very often not a subject of international law; see also Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. and Southern Pacific Properties Ltd (Hong Kong) v. Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3, Decision on Jurisdiction and Dissenting Opinion, 14 April 1988 (hereafter referred to as Southern Pacific Properties), excerpts of the Decision published in 16 Yearbook Commercial Arbitration (1991), 28, para. 46. This concept allows, firstly, to focus on the legal situation in the host State at the time when the investment is placed in that country. Secondly, it contains the idea that an expectation deserves more protection as it is increasingly backed by investment and, thirdly, it harbours an element of flexibility, i.e. legitimate expectations may fade in time and there may be a change of priorities in the host society; Dolzer, supra note 33, 78–79.
38 “[A]ny taking that is pursuant to discriminatory or arbitrary action, or any action that is without legitimate justification, is considered to be contrary to the non-discrimination requirement, even absent any singling-out on the basis of nationality. This includes prohibition of discrimination with regard to due process and payment of compensation requirements. Moreover, the non-discrimination requirement demands that governmental measures, procedures and practices be non-discriminatory even in the treatment of members of the same group of aliens.” UNCTAD, International Investment Agreements: Key Issues, Vol. 1, 2004, 239. That also means that in order to fall foul of the non-discrimination rule it is not required that the host State discriminates explicitly and formally against the foreign investor; it is sufficient that the State measure is discriminatory in its effect. For the application of this notion in recent NAFTA awards, refer to S. D. Myers, supra note 24, para. 308. See also Wälde &amp; Kolo, supra note 19, 835–837. For an older notion of discrimination and the general problem of its application, consult W. McKean, Equality and Discrimination under International Law (1983); E. W. Vierdag, The Concept of Discrimination in International Law (1973).
39 It is no easy task to establish the “intention” of a government. However, “formal statements of the responsible Minister or a series of circumstances pointing to the protectionist intent being the main motivator for a policy can be taken to indicate the ‘intention’”; Wälde &amp; Kolo, supra note 19, 826, footnote 66. See especially the First Partial Award, paras 171-195 and the separate Concurring Opinion of B. Schwartz, paras 62-63, in S. D. Myers.

The “special sacrifice” (Sonderopfer) concept is of primary importance in German constitutional expropriation law but is also known to the U.S. legal order; refer to Monogahela Navigation Corp. v. U.S., 148 US (1893), 312. Its underlying principle is discrimination, but it goes beyond this concept. It is intended to protect the minority against the majority, preventing the latter from shifting the costs of regulation to the former; see, Wälde &amp; Kolo, supra note 19, 845. The authors of this article are aware of the fact that it is critical to derive principles on indirect expropriation from cases decided in national fora, at least if one draws heavily only on the case law developed in one single nation (Wälde and Kolo indeed do so, arguing that U.S. law, as the law of the last hegemonic power, enjoys extra authority; Wälde &amp; Kolo, supra note 19, 821–822, even if it might be the most powerful nation at present. One must consider these national principles, but as part of a comparative study of the rules developed in other major jurisdictions. This approach would be in conformity with the teaching on the sources of international law in regard to the “general principles of law” embodied in Article 38 of the Statute of the ICJ; Dolzer, supra note 12, 69,76–78.

56 Virtually all Russian authors dealing with issues of the application of international treaties in the Russian Federation ground their positions on Article 15(4) of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, which states that “[t]he universally-recognized norms of international law and international treaties and agreements of the Russian Federation shall be a component part of its legal system. If an international treaty or agreement of the Russian Federation fixes rules other than those envisaged by law, the rules of the international agreement shall be applied.” See www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-02.htm (last visited 8 April 2009).
57 See, for instance, T. N. Neshatayeva, International Civil Procedure (2001), 46: “A question on the norms of jus cogens character, which mostly exist in the form of custom has already been touched upon. Considering these norms as principal ones apparently witnesses that the widest application of them is possible in the practice of the RF Constitutional Court […]. It is possible to assume that the priority of the interpretation of jus cogens norms (norms-principles) by the RF Constitutional Court is a feasible approach to this question for Russian judicial practice in general […] The issue becomes more complicated when it concerns other international legal norms of customary origin. Article 15 of the RF Constitution, and later Article 7 of the RF Civil Code included the norms of this type (the universally-recognized norms of international law) into the Russian legal system. But their place in the system is less clear in comparison to treaties […]. While hearing economical disputes in Arbitrazh Courts one can already meet participants’ references to well-known international norms of customary character. First of all, this is true for the substantive norms contained in widely known international conventions which are not mandatory for the Russian Federation […]. At this time courts are extremely cautious in appraisal of the procedural norms of those conventions that are not in force for Russia yet.”

63 Even if a revocation of a licence is well justified, the State must act with procedural regularity; otherwise, it would be held liable to pay compensation. In Middle Eastern Cement Shipping and Metalclad, the host State was not held liable for the cancellation of the licence but for a lack of due process, especially for a lack of transparency.
64 For a more detailed and principled account of this issue cf. S. Hindelang, ‘No Equals in Wrong? The Issue of Equality in a State of Illegality’, 7 Journal of World Investment and Trade 6 (2006), 883-897.
65 This means that the investor should be able to demonstrate that the State, in respect to the other instances, was not acting due to ignorance of these instances or legal obstacles which would bar it from enforcing the law in question but due to reasons unrelated to the aforementioned.
66 V. Götz, ‘Über die “Gleichheit im Unrecht”’, in O. Bachof et al. (eds), Verwaltungsrecht zwischen Freiheit, Teilhabe und Bindung: Festgabe aus Anlass des 25jährigen Bestehens des Bundesverwaltungsgerichts (1978), 254.
67 It is important to note that this observation applies only to the situation in which the State is obliged by law to interfere with a right of an investor in a certain way without any discretion but does so only on a selective basis. This is not to be confused with the notion of “no equality in wrong” (keine Gleichheit im Unrecht), in German constitutional doctrine. For the distinction - a detailed outline would go beyond the scope of this article - refer to C. Kölbel, Gleichheit “im Unrecht” (1998).
68 Id., 80, especially p. 141 (English summary); an argument stating that the principle of legality demands the immediate proper execution of the law in question against the investor implies that the principle of legality takes precedence of the principle of equality. This is doubtful. The principle of legality carries inherently the demand of due application of the principle of equality; Id., 43, 83.
69 Id., 82, 90.
70 An exception might be necessary in situations in which immediate action is necessary in order to avert damage to live and limb.

Wälde, ‘Investment Arbitration under the Energy Charter Treaty: An Overview of Key Issues’, 1 Transnational Dispute Management (2004) 2; available at: www.transnational-dispute-management.com (last visited 11 August 2005). The concept of transparency arrived late in international investment law. In regard to the standard of treatment, two cases deserve to be mentioned. In Metalclad, supra note, 23, para. 76, the NAFTA Tribunal defined the concept of transparency (stated in Article 1802 NAFTA) as requiring the following: “[…] all relevant legal requirements for the purpose of initiating, completing and successfully operating investments made, or intended to be made, under the Agreement should be capable of being readily known to all affected investors of another Party.” If a State becomes aware of “confusion or misunderstanding” among investors concerning the legal requirements to be fulfilled, the Party would have “the duty to ensure that the correct position [would be] promptly determined and clearly stated so that the investors can proceed with all appropriate expedition in the confident belief that they are acting in accordance with all relevant laws” (summary taken from OECD, Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in International Law, Working Papers on International Investment, No. 2004/3, 37). Since Mexico had failed to provide such a framework, it was held liable for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. However, this reading was rejected in a review by the Supreme Court of British Columbia on the grounds that the treaty obligation of transparency was outside Chapter Eleven and, thus, outside the fair and equitable treatment standard. Moreover, the NAFTA Tribunal was charged to have failed to have put forward any evidence that the obligation of transparency has become customary international law. Also, in Maffezini, a lack of transparency in administrative conduct was established, which led the Tribunal, in connection with other factors, to the conclusion that Spain had violated the fair and equitable treatment standard contained in the Spain–Argentina BIT. No explanation was given on the precise meaning of the lack of transparency. See Maffezini (Argentina) v. Kingdom of Spain, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Award, 13 November 2000.

74 Reported by K. Hobér, ‘Investment Arbitration in Eastern Europe: Recent Cases on Expropriation’, 14 American Review of International Arbitration (2003), 407. This case was concerned with the removal and subsequent public auctioning of a ship by Latvian governmental officials due to an alleged breach of a lease contract on an anchorage. The Tribunal based its finding of indirect expropriation on the failure of the government to inform the investor about the (alleged) invalidity (retroactive change of laws) of the lease contract in due time (four months inactivity) and cacophonic statements of a governmental official, the participation of governmental officers in the (alleged) illegal activity of concluding the lease contract and the missing proportionality between the (alleged) wrongful act of the investor and State measures; id., 414.
75 The NAFTA Tribunal in Metalclad dealt with a case in which the investor did not obey the local building and environmental rules and thus acted unlawfully in regard to national rules. However, representations were made by governmental officials who were not aware of their own legal order. It was held that the investor’s legitimate expectations in the lawfulness of his undertaking cannot be destroyed if he learns about the illegality of the investment after it was made.

84 CME, supra note 31. The actions and non-actions of the Czech Media Council were not part of proper administrative process (no justification for the sudden change in the interpretation of the legal situation or other regulatory measures and its enforcement (1996) and the illegal collusion (1999) with a Czech national with a protectionist intent).
85 A first, rather simple argument relates to the rules of causality. An infringement of a given right cannot be imputed to someone if it can be demonstrated that the infringement would also have been caused if this person had acted correctly. For the example here, this would mean that the infringement (indirect expropriation) would also have occurred if the host State had lawfully revoked the licence. This apparently is not the case. Thus, the host State must have inflicted the infringement. A second argument may be drawn from the second Amco v. Indonesia Award on the Merits, Amco Asia Corporation and Others v. The Republic of Indonesia, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Resubmitted, Award on the Merits, 31 May 1990 (hereafter referred to as Amco II (Merits)), in para. 143, the Tribunal states: “[E]ven were a decision on grounds other than those stated in the Degree in principle sustainable, they could no more be lawful than the decision made on grounds of shortfall of investment, because of the general background that pervaded the decision-making.” It does not matter that the same result could have been reached in another way, i.e. that the foreign investment could have also been adversely affected by measures which are in principle sustainable; it is only the process of how this result is reached (and that this process was ultimately malconducted) which matters. Of the same opinion: Sornarajah, supra note 1, 390.
86 It is open to question whether all of the loss inflicted upon the foreign investor by the discriminatory application of certain tax laws can be attributed to the host State due to the fact that substantial damages would have occurred also in the case of a lawful (in terms of public international law) revocation of the licence. The Amco II (Merits) Award casts doubts on this; in para. 174, it reads: “To argue, as did Indonesia, that although there had been procedural irregularities, a ‘fair BKPM’ [the governmental body acting on behalf of Indonesia] would still have revoked the licence, because of Amco's own shortcomings, is to misaddress causality. The Tribunal cannot pronounce upon what a ‘fair BKPM’ would have done. This is both speculative, and not the issue before it. Rather, it is required to characterise the acts that BKPM did engage in and to see if those acts, if unlawful, caused damage to Amco. It is not required to see if, had it acted fairly, harm might then rather have been attributed to Amco’s own fault.”

91 Decision of the Russian Constitutional Court, No. 15, dated 16 July 2005.
92 For example, Article 113 of the Tax Code, No. 146-FZ, dated 31 July 1998 (as effective on the date when the Yukos Decision of the Constitutional Court was passed), stated that “a person cannot be held liable for a tax offense if three years (the statute of limitations) have expired since the day when the offense was committed or since the first day after the end of the tax period during which the offense committed.” (this Article of the Tax Code was amended on 27 July 2006). In the Yukos Decision of the Constitutional Court, No. 36-O, dated 18 January 2005, the Court re-interpreted this provision to apply only for “conscientious” taxpayers. It was deemed not to apply to “un-conscientious” taxpayers, which Yukos was found to be. However, the wording of the statute does not actually provide a basis for this interpretation.
93 Revere, supra note 19, 291 “In our view, the effects of the Jamaican Government’s actions in repudiating its long term commitments to RJA (the subsidiary of RC), have substantially the same impact on effective control over use and operation as if the properties were themselves conceded by a concession contract that was repudiated […]” For a discussion, refer to R.

102 The interference in domestic politics by foreign investors seen as agents of their home State is a well-known instance (as with Allende in Chile) and has been addressed by prohibition in many soft-law instruments (voluntary codes of conduct). However, no hard-law international obligation has arisen so far. In general, there has been little movement in formulating binding obligations of foreign investors (multinational corporations). Refer to Sornarajah, supra note 1, 171, 174-182. Moreover, in general, home States do not carry responsibility for the acts of their nationals not acting on behalf of the home State abroad; refer to Article 4-11 of the International Law Commision’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.

The state of necessity, though in the context of treatment standards due under a BIT regime, was also invoked and lengthily discussed in a recent ICSID arbitration, CMS, supra note 8, paras 304-394; Enron Corp., supra note 8, para. 93, Sempra Energy, supra note 8, paras 333-355; LG&amp;E Capital, supra note 36, para. 201-266.
105 CMS, supra note 8, para. 315.
106 Very high standards of proof are required, and it is doubtful whether an international tribunal would accept a state of necessity in the situation at hand. See CMS, paras 319–331.

108 For case law on the legality of the investment in general see, Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Philippines, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Award, 17 August 2007; see also C. Borris &amp; R. Hennecke, ‘Das Kriterium der Einhaltung von Vorschriften nationalen Rechts in ICSID-Schiedsverfahren - Anmerkungen zum Schiedsspruch in der Sache Fraport v. Philippines’, 6 German Arbitration Journal (2008) 2, 49-58.
109 As demonstrated, for instance, in the Media Most Gusinsky case, in which the partly government-owned Gazprom giant guaranteed two loans to Media Most in 1998 that totalled US$ 380 million, secured by a 40 per cent piece of the company. After criticizing the politics of the Kremlin, with the Kremlin allegedly being instrumental in bankrupting Media Most by calling in the loans, the owner of Media Most, Mr Gusinsky, was arrested, allegedly without any charges, and he was allegedly compelled to sign an agreement to sell his company. Available at www.mytimes.com/2000/11/15/world/russian-gas-company-pulls-out-of-deal-with-media-tycoon.html (last visited 29 April 2009). In response to this, the ECHR ruled that the Russian government had violated Articles 5 and 18 of the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to Gusinsky, namely his rights to freedom and security. The Court ruled that the violation in itself was enough for moral damages to be awarded. As a result, it asked the Russian Federation to pay € 88.000 in damages. Available at http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;action=html&amp;highlight=russia%20%7C%2070276/01&amp;sessionid=22944796&amp;skin=hudoc-en (last visited 29 April 2009). No arguments as to illegal expropriation or moral damages because of such violations seem to have been made before Russian courts.
110 One way to force an international investor to resort to national jurisdictions is the “local remedies requirement”. However, the exhaustion of local remedies as a precondition for commencing an international investment arbitration is nowadays rarely required by BITs; C. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2001), 391-393. For an appraisal of alleged new tendencies in arbitration, see C. Schreuer, ‘Calvo’s Grandchildren: The Return of Local Remedies in Investment Arbitration’, 4 The Law and Practice of International Courts and Tribunals (2005) 1, 1-3.
