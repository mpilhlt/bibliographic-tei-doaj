6) The relevance of the Ares-Aphrodite song to the central plot of the Odyssey has been much discussed. For a recent interpretation and bibliography see N. Austin, Archery al the Dark of the Moon, Berkeley and Los Angeles 1975, 159-62.

Cf. also Stesich. r. 232 (PMG), where ‘““playfulness’” and song belong to Apolio, grief and lament to Hades (palgmosynai, moipai: kedea, stonachai).

12) Sce Herington, 29, who suggest that the ‘“signals’’, samasin, in the next verse refer to the signs between poet and dancers. But the meaning, given the context, should probabiy not be limited to the (mortal) performance alone. For the circumstances of such performances see now M. Lefkowitz, AJPh 109, 1988, 1-11, and M. Heath, ibid., 180-95.

15) On such myths of first beginnings in Pindar see my essay, Naming, Truth, and Creation in the Poetics of Pindar, ‘“Diacritics’” 16, 1986, 65-83.
16 The analogies between Hieron and Zeus as conquerors of disorder are further developed in Hiero’s victorious containment of the ‘“Phoenician and Carthaginian battle cry"", paralle! also to the mainland victories over the Persians in 72-80.
17) Forthe association of Apollo and the Castalian spring with poetry cf. Pae. 6,7ff.; also Pyrh. 4.294, 295
18) Sce the works of Herington and Gentili, above, note 3.

21) Sce J. M. Hurwit, The Art and Culture of Early Greece, Ithaca, (N. Y.) 1985, 49. There is perhaps further corroboration for the historicity of Phemius’ coucern with his Iyre in the fact that the lyre or other instrument sometimes appears in scenes on geometric vases. Farlier, there is the marble statuette of the ‘harpist'’ of the Cycladic period. Cf. also Herington, 17-19, with plate 11 (citharodist and his Iyre by the Berlin Painter in the Metropolitan Museum, New York), for the importance of the Iyre later in the archaic period. :
22) The most receni discussion | have scen is that of W.G. Thalmann, Conventions of Form and Thought in Eariy Greek Poetry, Baltimore 1984, 126f., who suggests that the word implies «an innate ability exercised spontaneousiy» and compares k. Merc. 474 and 489. Cf. also Soph., Ai. 700, where the similar adtodati is used of the songs of Pan that come unbidden from the god.
23) For recent discussion of this poern see A, Burnett, Three Archaic Poets, Cambridge, (Mass.) 1983, 259ff., especially p. 263f.

27) For the problems of this much discussed passage see most recently G. W. Most, Pindar, O. 2.83-90, CQ 36, 1986, 304-16, with a review of previcus scholarship.
28) The blindness of the Homeric bard would, of course, increase dependence and lessen mobility. Although not all the singers in Homer are blind (e.g. the Ithacan Phemius), one wonders whether the profession attracted the blind, as it did, for example, in Japanese culture. The association of blindness and the singer persists not only for Demodocus and the poet of the Homeric Hymn to (Delian) Apoilo (171ff.), but also in the myth of Thamyris and in the story of Stesichorus’ palinode.
29) Cf. Pindar’s defense against charges of venality in Isthmian 2, which reflects a point where the poet is still somewhat uncomfortable with his ‘’professional”’ role. The aristocratic ties of friendship and clanship are still the ideal motivation behind such poetry.
30) For some suggestion in this direction see my essay, Greek Tragedy: Truth, Writing, and the Representation of the Self, in Mnemai: Classical Studies in Memory of Karl K. Huitey, ed. Harold J. Evjen, Chico (CA) 1984, 41-67, now in my Inferpreting Greek Tragedy: Myth, Poetry, Text, Ithaca, (N. Y.}) 1986, especially p. 80ff. ] gratefully acknowledge a Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1985-86, during which this study was written.
